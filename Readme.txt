The main objective of this project is to design a learning center.  The main objective of the teacher management system is to make the admin add and display records for teachers, in addition to the fact that the admin is able to update the data related to the teacher from the address and phone number, in addition to deleting the data of a teacher if he has left work for a period of more than 6 months. Following the proposal submitted on week 8, we have finished our project and will now be demonstrating the technical aspects of the two programs side by side. In the process, we can compare the solutions to the same problem using Array of Structure & Linked Lists. We will be attaching relevant snippets of code wherever possible or necessary.
